* First, we have to understand how the pattern of killing
people by witches is where the killing has a unique pattern
and the pattern is actually a pattern of Fibonacci numbers, 
where Fibonacci numbers are a series of numbers where each number 
in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. 
This series usually starts with the numbers 0 and 1. So, we have:

Fibbonacy Number Addition Pattern = 1,2,4,5,7,12,...,n


S(1) = 1 
S(2) = 2 
S(3) = 4 
S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) + 1

Where S(n) is the sum of the nth Fibonacci numbers.

by applying Fibbonacy numbers we can 
find out the number of people killed 
in the nth year and here I use the iteration 
concept to find the sum pattern and then 
iterate again to find the number of 
iteration patterns based on the value n

* The second step is to understand how the previous programmer's 
technique is to find out the average population killed by witches 
where the number of people killed is based on the nth year of the 
fibbonacy number and n is obtained from the reduction between the 
year of death - year of birth, here I am trying to create a program 
that can make the year of death - age of death a parameter n in determining 
the number of deaths based on the iterative program of the fibbonacy number 
pattern, I also add that if the result of the reduction < 0 then the number 
of deaths is not found this is because the fibbonaci number pattern starts from 0.

* The third step after finding the number of deaths based on 
the sum of the fibbonacy numbers based on n (year of death - age of death)
My data is stored in an array so this allows me to create a program 
that can loop through the input.

* The final step is after getting the data that has been 
stored in the array, I display the data using the pandas 
library as an aid in displaying the data and performing 
calculations to find the average value of the data using 
the formula for the amount of data / amount of data
